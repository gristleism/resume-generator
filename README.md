# Resume Generator

Resume generator takes a file in [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) format and generates a formatted webpage and matching PDF automatically.

It can be run manually or works extremely well with a static hosting tool like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to allow an automatic rebuild of resources on changes to the repository.
